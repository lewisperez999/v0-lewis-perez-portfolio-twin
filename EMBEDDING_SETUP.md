# Embedding Management Setup

## Current Status
The embedding management system is currently running with **mock embeddings** for testing purposes.

## Why Mock Embeddings?
- The Vercel AI Gateway endpoint returned 404 errors
- This allows testing the full embedding pipeline without API dependencies
- Mock embeddings are deterministic and based on content hashing

## To Enable Real Embeddings:

### Option 1: OpenAI API Direct
1. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env.local` file
2. Uncomment the OpenAI API code in `app/admin/actions/embeddings.ts`
3. Comment out the mock embedding generation

### Option 2: Vercel AI Gateway  
1. Verify the correct Vercel AI Gateway endpoint
2. Update the API endpoint in the `generateEmbedding` function
3. Test with a small content chunk first

## Current Mock Embedding Features:
✅ Deterministic embeddings based on content  
✅ Proper 1024-dimensional vectors (matching Upstash Vector config)  
✅ Full pipeline testing (generation → storage → search)  
✅ Job management and progress tracking  
✅ Vector database integration with Upstash  

## Dimension Configuration:
- **Upstash Vector Database**: 1024 dimensions
- **Mock Embeddings**: 1024 dimensions (matching database)
- **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small**: 1536 dimensions (will need dimension adjustment when switching)

## Testing the System:
1. Go to `/admin/embeddings`
2. Click "Full Regeneration" to process all 22 content chunks
3. Monitor job progress in real-time
4. Use "Test Search" to validate vector search functionality

The system is fully functional for testing - just swap in real API calls when ready!
