              I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience delivering secure, scalable, and
              high-performing systems across banking, telecom, and e-commerce domains. My expertise lies in Java, Spring
              Boot, APIs, PostgreSQL, and AWS, with proven achievements in performance optimization, data migration, and
              microservices architecture.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Relocating to Melbourne in 2023, I've since complemented my enterprise software background with freelance
              full-stack development (React, Next.js, Shopify) and formal studies in cybersecurity and
              telecommunications network engineering. I'm motivated by solving complex technical challenges that deliver
              measurable business impact.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              My career goal is to grow into a Solutions Architect or Engineering Lead role within the next 3â€“5 years,
              bringing enterprise-grade reliability with adaptability and continuous professional growth. I thrive in
              feedback-driven, knowledge-sharing environments where I can mentor teams and deliver innovative solutions.
