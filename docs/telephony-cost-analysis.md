## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Technical Optimizations

#### Response Caching
```typescript
// Cache common responses to reduce AI costs
const responseCache = new Map();

// Potential savings: 30-50% on AI service costs
// Implementation cost: 2-3 hours development
// ROI: Break-even at 100+ calls/month
```

#### Audio Compression
```typescript
// Optimize audio quality vs. bandwidth
const audioSettings = {
  codec: 'opus', // Better compression
  bitrate: 24000, // Optimized for voice
  sampleRate: 16000 // Sufficient for speech
};

// Potential savings: 20-30% on bandwidth costs
// Quality impact: Minimal for voice
```

#### Smart Call Routing
```typescript
// Route calls based on time zones and availability
function getOptimalRouting(callerLocation, currentTime) {
  if (isBusinessHours(callerLocation, currentTime)) {
    return 'ai_assistant';
  } else {
    return 'voicemail_only';
  }
}

// Potential savings: 40-60% on off-hours processing
// User experience: Improved relevance
```

### 2. Business Process Optimizations

#### Call Duration Management
- **Average call target:** 3-4 minutes
- **Optimization techniques:**
  - Concise responses
  - Structured information delivery
  - Smart escalation triggers
- **Potential savings:** 25-35% on call duration costs

#### Selective Recording
```typescript
// Record only important or escalated calls
function shouldRecordCall(callContext) {
  return callContext.escalated || 
         callContext.callerType === 'potential_employer' ||
         callContext.callDuration > 300; // 5+ minutes
}

// Potential savings: 60-80% on recording/transcription costs
```

#### Time-based Service Levels
| Time Period | Service Level | Cost Impact |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Business Hours | Full AI + Recording | 100% cost |
| Extended Hours | AI only | 70% cost |
| Off Hours | Voicemail only | 20% cost |

### 3. Scaling Economics

#### Volume Discounts
Twilio offers enterprise pricing at higher volumes:

| Monthly Minutes | Standard Rate | Enterprise Rate | Savings |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| 0-1,000 | $0.0085 | $0.0085 | 0% |
| 1,000-10,000 | $0.0085 | $0.0075 | 12% |
| 10,000+ | $0.0085 | $0.0065 | 24% |

#### Alternative Providers
